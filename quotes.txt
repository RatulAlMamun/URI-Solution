1500 years ago, everybody knew the earth was the center of the universe. 500 years ago, everybody knew the earth was flat. And 15 minutes ago you knew that people were not alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.

-- A person lives three lives. The first one end with the loss of naivete, the second with the loss of innocence, and the third with the loss of life itself.
-- Pain is a vessel/ship. Desire is a compass. That is all a man capable of.
-- The ways of the heart, can not be explained. It does what it wants.
-- What we know is a drop. What we do not know is a ocean.

Don't be afraid to graze your knees
Jump over the fences, climb up trees
Folk, they will say
Don't fly too high
But put on those wings
and reach for the sky.
And it's all right to be all wrong
You've got to be weak
if you wanna be strong
So dance your own dance, sing your own song
And live the life you dreamed of
Till the dreamer is gone.

Flight of the Phoneix:
-- I think a man only needs one thing in life. He just needs someone to love. If you can't give him that, then give him something to hope for. And if you can't give him that, just give him something to do.
